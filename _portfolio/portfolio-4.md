# Abstract
In this work, the efficiency of truss in structural
mechanics is investigated, with a focus on Warren-type truss for
bridge design. A simulation was conducted between two models,
one with and one without truss respectively, and was modelled
as a linear elasticity problem by applying uniform weight until
the structure material reaches its yield point. The results show
that optimizing a bridge model with planar, Warren-type truss
results in an improvement of almost 6 times when compared
to a model without diagonal truss members. This confirms the
theory that a truss is an efficient method of distributing the load
on a structure. The improvements are presented using qualitative
and quantitative data gathered from running a condition sweep
simulation.

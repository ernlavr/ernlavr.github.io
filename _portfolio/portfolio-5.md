# Abstract
Image feature extraction is a vital pre-processing
step for image processing tasks such as tracking, object detection
or recognition, and image stitching. There are multiple methods
for feature extraction such as ORB, SIFT, HOG and others.
This contribution describes a from-scratch implementation of
Histogram of Oriented Gradients algorithm that is quantitatively
evaluated for performance and functionality. Quantitative tests
suggest that the implementation suffers from bugs as the gener-
ated feature vector has statistically significant differences when
compared to production-grade implementation.

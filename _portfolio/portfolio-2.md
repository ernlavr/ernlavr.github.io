title: "The Effect of Personalized Music in Advertisement on Emotions and Memory Performance"
excerpt: "How is a subject's memory performance affected when experiencing video content with and without music that is personalized? We leveraged Spotify's API for music affective features, test subjects' mood at the time of the test and their Spotify listening trends to find the best matching song and overlay it with the video content.

# Abstract
Indoor navigation is a topic undergoing research within robotics, but
can also be applied in commerce, manufacturing or industrial applications.
We investigate how AR Head-Mounted Display Magic Leap 1 can be integrated into an indoor navigation framework aimed for commerce or asset
management. Magic Leap 1 supports spatial mapping of real-life environment as well as tracking users in six degrees-of-freedom, and provides the
ability of recognizing and estimating the orientation in space of fiducial
markers. We propose an end-to-end framework that is able of mapping
out an environment, digitally processing it by using the A* algorithm for shortest path, and providing a framework
for connecting client devices for issuing navigation requests. 

Our system
proves to function end-to-end although fails to improve task completion
time when tested in a mock-up environment. This can be attributed to
over-simplified test task, low resolution of guidance elements and general
inexperience with AR devices by the test subjects. Our study concludes
that the first iteration design should have an improved user interaction
and it should be tested with a different methodology. It also identifies
future work and features such as IoT communication, computer vision
integration and a revamped user interface based around human-computer
interaction research.
